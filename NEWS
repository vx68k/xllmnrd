This file describes major changes and important notes for each release.

# Version 2.0

This release adds a new feature and contains the source code of the GNU getopt
functions for porting to non-GNU systems.  The 'configure' script now attempts
to enable C++11 on GCC for the test suite if not enabled.

## New feature

* It now answers all the IPv6 addresses of the interface it sends a packet on.

# Version 1.2.1

This release fixes a configure check that failed on CentOS ([issue #41][]).

[Issue #41]: https://bitbucket.org/kazssym/xllmnrd/issue/41

# Version 1.2.0

This release adds no new fundamental features but it contains a sample init
script for LSB-conforming GNU/Linux operating systems and a minor workaround
for recent versions of the GNU C Library.  In addition, Japanese translations
of the command line messages are now included.

# Version 1.1.0

This release adds a new command-line option.

## New feature

* It can now make the pid file specified by the `-p FILE` or `--pid-file=FILE`
  option, though it does not make one by default.

# Version 1.0.1

This release fixes an error check bug ([issue #30][]).

[Issue #30]: https://bitbucket.org/kazssym/xllmnrd/issue/30

# Version 1.0.0

This release is the first version of xllmnrd.

## New feature

* It now responds to an AAAA query with the link-local address of the
  interface on which the query has been received.

## Known limitations

* It does not implement all the requirements of the LLMNR specification, and
  especially name conflicts are not handled at all.
  So **do not** use this version in a mission-critical environment yet.

# Version 1.0y2 (milestone 1.0y2)

This release is the second milestone for version 1.0.0.

## New features

* It now responds to queries that match its host name, but with no answers.
* A new command-line option is added to set its host name explicitly.
* Localization support is added for localizing command-line interface.

## Known limitations

* All responses have no answer sections and senders will just get no addresses
  both for IPv6 and for IPv4.

# Version 1.0y1 (milestone 1.0y1)

This release is the first milestone for version 1.0.0.

## New features

* It now joins the LLMNR multicast group automatically for each network
  interface that has a link-scope IPv6 address.

## Known limitations

* It _does not_ respond yet but logs each received query via syslog.  The
  working responding code is planned to be implemented in the next release.
